# Requirements

## 1.Introduction

### 1.1 System Purpose:
We are going to define a system which enables players to interact with the system and subsequently have the response(Win or Lose).

 ### 1.2 System Scope:
   
 System can easily take inputs from users and give the responses for the same. Project will be really helpfull for entertrainment purpose.   
 
 ## 2.Research and Literature Survey
 Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. 
 It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. 
 Here, we are going to implement this game using python. In this project We have using  random function which which produce random inputs and becomes one of the default player of the game.
 
 ## 3. Description:
 The whole system is developed in python programming, here we have taken inputs from Two users.
 The final results is mutually inclusive. The decision algorithm is based on if-else statement.
 ### developed on:
 visual Studio code.
 ### Programming language used:
 Python
 
 ## 4. Cost and feature:
 ### 4.1 Cost:
 Since the system is developed on open source, Cost of the system is keep aside.
 ### 4.2 Features:
 a. users input
 
 b. predict win or lose.
 
 ## SWOT analysis:

 ## 6. 4W's and 1'H
 ### Who:
 The system is design to the children for entertraining purpose.
 
 ### What:
 A simple two player game.
 
 ### When:
 When the supposed audience wants to play something, this game will provide the basis for the same.
 
 ### Where:
 Can be put to use when two persons wants to play an predictive game.
 
 ### How:
 A System will open asking the users to give input according to their interest, the second users can't see the input of the first one.
 After the second person give his input, submodule will calculate the result. The result will be flashed in a second on the screen.
